# Contributing
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've changed any code, update the documentation.
3. Make sure your code lints.
4. Write your unit tests to cover the changes.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU GPLv3 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU GPLv3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) license that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/InternetNZ/pyepp/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/InternetNZ/pyepp/issues); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
We follow [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
